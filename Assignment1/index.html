        the experience?
      </label>
      <div class="answer3">
        The first thing I paid attention to is the patterns in motion and images
        that make up a large portion of the page. The moving things lead me to
        watch the whole website. And I think my mother-tongue system may impact
        it. Although the words are so big in some pages, for the first time, I
        still think they are just like descriptions.

        3 What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </label>
      <img class="pic" alt="music" src="5.png" />
      <div class="answer">
        I mainly focused on areas that used video and animation interactions.
        The combination of video and audio, coupled with the constant changes in
        visual effects, not only showcases rich content, but also makes the
        overall narrative vivid and layered, making it worth savoring over and
        over again.

      </label>
      <img class="pic" alt="music" src="6.png" />
      <div class="answer">
        The most common operation is repeated scrolling (including up and down
        scrolling and partial horizontal sliding). This repetitive gesture
        constantly refreshes the perception of the content and feels the changes
        brought about by different interactive feedback.

      </label>
      <img class="pic" alt="music" src="7.png" />
      <div class="answer">
        The interactive experience is designed to create a smooth and immersive
        sensory journey. The clever combination of text, pictures and videos
        guides users into an engaging narrative. Each section is independent and
        interconnected. At the same time, the layout design is eclectic but
        still comfortable, and the color matching is also very sophisticated.
        <br />It not only shows the aesthetics of architecture or design art,
        but also hopes to let users feel the collision of innovative thinking
        and multi-layered information in the interaction. <br />

          Interactive transition: The movement of the mouse brings about the
          conversion of images and videos in the screen, filling the gap in
          reading. <br />Clear layers: Texts of different sizes and styles
          provide breathing space for the page. <br />Color matching: Some
          bright colors complement black and white to create a sense of harmony.
          <br />Multimedia integration: The clever combination of video, audio
          and animation forms an integrated artistic narrative atmosphere.

        7 What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</label
      >
      <img class="pic" alt="music" src="10.png" />
      <div class="answer">
        Each chapter is like a short but in-depth interaction, with both
        transition and review, allowing users to review and explore repeatedly
        after a short experience, thereby constantly discovering new details and
        meanings. <br />The overall feeling is short, suitable for multiple
        short experiences.

        <div class="answer">
          It uses repeated interaction patterns—scrolling, zooming,
          transitioning—and a menu for non-linear access. These cues subtly
          suggest it's okay to leave and return multiple times. <br />
          1 Modular chapters: Each section has a clear beginning and end, marked
          by visual transitions and unique interactive elements <br />2 Repeated
          interaction cues: The alternating use of text, motion, and sound in
          similar patterns suggests a rhythm that can be revisited <br />3
          Nonlinear structure: The ability to jump between sections from the
          menu invites personal pacing and selective focus <br />4 Subtle
          encouragements to pause and explore: Some transitions slow down or
          wait for user input, prompting deeper engagement <br />

      <div class="answer">
        I’m encouraged to explore, click, scroll, and even pause to appreciate
        transitions. It’s not only just about reading or watching, it’s also
        about noticing patterns, textures, interactions and relationships. The
        layout and interaction design reward curiosity and intentional
        explosion. Joining is important.

      <div class="answer">
        The most frustrating part is the video plays as my mouse moves. The
        video segments controlled by scroll speed were hard to manage. When the
        swipe is fast it plays fast.And when the mouse stops it stops playing
        too. The experience is unfriendly to the people who are dizzy in 3D.
        This part may make the situation worse.

      <div class="answer4">
        I really like every special change in every part, from the static photos
        to the lines or interactive diagrams and then faded into videos. This
        process depends on the same thing which is the center of every part. The
        dividing line for each page connects them. Also, there are some
        connecting skills that help the process more smoothly, such as masking,
        layering, and animation.
