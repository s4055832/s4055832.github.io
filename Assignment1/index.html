        The first thing I paid attention to is the patterns in motion and images
        that make up a large portion of the page. The moving things lead me to
        watch the whole website. And I think my mother-tongue system may impact
        it. Although the words are so big in some pages, for the first time, I
        still think they are just like descriptions.
